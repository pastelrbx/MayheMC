# MayheMC
[They've done it!](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition)  
Minecraft won't be obfuscated as of 26.1-snapshot-1(at least that's what I think)
## What the fuck is MayheMC?
I mean, I don't even know yet, but the plan is to make a JNI-based modloader which uses C++ instead of Java.  
To keep it stupid: Fabric, but .dll(or .so for my linux users :3) mods instead of .jar mods.
